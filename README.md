# Data Structures Lab ~ Notepad

This lab was early in the semester of Data Structures, and was an extension of a primitive version of Notepad to include undo/redo functionality. The Notepad was to be left unchanged, in order to exercise encapsulation of new concepts that might be worked on through a separate team in a workplace scenario.
